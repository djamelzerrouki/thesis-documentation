Workflow technology is driven by the need for businesses to improve their performance, including information control, better collaboration between stakeholders, and better business and operational processes.

The goal of our project is to design and build an administrative Workflow system for the Cloud environment.


In order to meet this objective, we have developed an administrative Workflow for the Cloud environment, enabling the automatic execution and operation of organizational processes to formalize, normalize and speed up the processing of documents and other tasks.

To perform this work, we had to conduct a theoretical study to understand the Cloud domain and Workflow then use the information from this study to complete the analysis, design and system implementation.
